Fact Tables for Simulations

# What does it do?

This tool generates machine code from CSV tables taken from the ministery of internal affairs. In three steps:

* Read CSV's
* Generate Compilable Code
* Compile to Ahead of Time (AOT) machine code.

This allows for fast performance in simulations by having state objects that optimally use the CPU and Memory speed in a computer system.
